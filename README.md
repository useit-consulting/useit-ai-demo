# Simple Component Library

A collection of basic JavaScript components designed to help beginners learn web development. This project demonstrates how to create interactive components using vanilla JavaScript, without any frameworks or libraries.

## Components

1. **Counter**
   - A simple counter with increment and decrement buttons
   - Demonstrates basic event handling and DOM manipulation

2. **Todo List**
   - Add and remove tasks
   - Shows how to manage lists and handle user input
   - Demonstrates basic state management

3. **Color Picker**
   - Interactive color selection with live preview
   - Shows how to work with different input types
   - Demonstrates real-time updates

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser
3. Try out each component and experiment with the code!

## Learning Resources

Each component is written in vanilla JavaScript and includes comments explaining how it works. To learn more:

1. Open the component files in the `components` directory
2. Read the comments in the code
3. Try modifying the code to see what happens
4. Experiment with adding new features

## File Structure

```
├── index.html          # Main HTML file
├── styles.css          # Global styles
└── components/         # Component JavaScript files
    ├── counter.js      # Counter component
    ├── todo.js         # Todo list component
    └── color-picker.js # Color picker component
```

## Tips for Learning

- Start by understanding one component at a time
- Try to modify small parts of the code and see what happens
- Use your browser's developer tools to inspect the elements
- Don't be afraid to break things - that's how you learn!

## Next Steps

Once you're comfortable with these components, try:
1. Adding new features to existing components
2. Creating your own components
3. Combining components together
4. Adding animations and transitions
